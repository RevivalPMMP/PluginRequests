# Plugin Requests
Place your requests for plugins to revive here.

Plugins can be requested in the issues tab.    
Not every plugin that gets submitted will be worked on. We too have our daily schedules and can't spend our whole day on coding!

#### When requesting a plugin, please make sure to:
- [x] Put the title in the issue name.
- [x] Give a link to the github page of the plugin.
- [x] Address any errors/issues you encounter for us to watch out for.

#### Thank you!
